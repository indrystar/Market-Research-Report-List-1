<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Etco2 Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>For Intubated Mobility</li><li>For Non-Intubated Mobility</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The EtCO2 module market includes two main types: one for intubated mobility and another for non-intubated mobility. The intubated mobility module is designed for patients who have a breathing tube inserted into their airway, allowing for continuous monitoring and measurement of exhaled carbon dioxide levels. On the other hand, the non-intubated mobility module is used for patients who do not have a breathing tube, providing similar monitoring capabilities for those who can breathe spontaneously. These modules play a crucial role in ensuring accurate and real-time assessment of a patient's respiratory status during mobility.</p></p>
