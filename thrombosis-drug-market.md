<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thrombosis Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>P2Y12 Platelet Inhibitor</li><li>Xa Inhibitor</li><li>Heparin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thrombosis drug market consists of various types, including P2Y12 platelet inhibitors, Xa inhibitors, and heparin. P2Y12 platelet inhibitors work by blocking the activation of platelets, preventing them from forming blood clots. Xa inhibitors, on the other hand, target a specific enzyme involved in the clotting process, inhibiting its activity. Heparin is a widely used anticoagulant drug that prevents the formation of clotting factors. These different types of drugs provide physicians with a range of options when prescribing medications to prevent or treat thrombosis.</p></p>
