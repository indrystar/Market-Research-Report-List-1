<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stacker Cranes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monocolumn Stacker Cranes</li><li>Two-column Stacker Cranes</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Stacker cranes are used in warehouses and distribution centers to efficiently store and retrieve goods. There are two main types of stacker cranes: monocolumn stacker cranes and two-column stacker cranes. </p><p>Monocolumn stacker cranes consist of a single column that moves along a rail system, allowing the crane to travel back and forth along the aisle. This type of crane is generally used in narrow spaces where there is limited aisle width.</p><p>Two-column stacker cranes, on the other hand, have two columns that move independently along separate rail systems. This design allows for greater flexibility in retrieving goods from different locations within the warehouse and is often used in wider aisle spaces.</p></p>
