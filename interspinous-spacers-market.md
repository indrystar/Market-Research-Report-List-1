<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Interspinous Spacers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Compressible Spacers</li><li>Compressible Spacers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Interspinous spacers are devices used to treat spinal stenosis or disc degeneration by restoring proper spacing between the vertebrae. Non-compressible spacers are fixed devices that maintain a constant height, providing immediate stability and preventing extension of the spine. Compressible spacers, on the other hand, are flexible devices that allow for movement and absorb shock. They offer a dynamic stabilization effect, reducing pressure on the spinal nerves. Both types of spacers aim to alleviate pain and improve spinal alignment, but they differ in their approach and functionality.</p></p>
