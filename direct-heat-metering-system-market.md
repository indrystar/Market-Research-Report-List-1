<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Direct Heat Metering System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Evaporating Style Heat Cost Allocator</li><li>Electric Heat Cost Allocator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Direct heat metering systems are used to measure and allocate the cost of heating in residential or commercial buildings. The evaporating style heat cost allocator is a type of direct heat metering system that uses the heat to evaporate a liquid, which then expands to move a disc and measure the heat consumption. The electric heat cost allocator, on the other hand, uses electrical heating elements to measure the heat consumption, providing an accurate and efficient method of cost allocation. These systems help ensure fair and efficient distribution of heating costs among building occupants.</p></p>
