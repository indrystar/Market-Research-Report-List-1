<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chip Thick Film Resistor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through Hole</li><li>SMD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Chip Thick Film Resistor Market can be classified into two main types: Through Hole and Surface Mount Device (SMD). Through Hole resistors are mounted by inserting their leads into mounting holes on a PCB and soldering them on the other side, providing strong mechanical stability. SMD resistors, on the other hand, are much smaller in size, allowing for higher component density on the PCB. These resistors are directly soldered onto the surface of the PCB, reducing the space required for mounting and enabling automated assembly processes.</p></p>
