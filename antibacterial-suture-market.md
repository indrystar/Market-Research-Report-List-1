<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antibacterial Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Suture</li><li>Non-Absorbable Sutures</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Antibacterial Suture Market comprises two types: Absorbable Suture and Non-Absorbable Suture. Absorbable sutures are made from materials that break down naturally in the body over time, eliminating the need for removal. They are commonly used in internal surgeries. On the other hand, non-absorbable sutures are made from materials that are not absorbed by the body and require removal after the wounds heal. These sutures are typically used in external or superficial surgeries where the sutures need to be taken out manually.</p></p>
