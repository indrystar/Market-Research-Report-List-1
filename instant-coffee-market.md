<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Instant Coffee Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spray-drying</li><li>Freeze-drying</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Instant coffee is available in two major market types: spray-drying and freeze-drying. Spray-drying involves spraying a liquid coffee extract into a hot drying chamber, where it rapidly evaporates, forming small powder particles. This method is popular due to its cost-effectiveness and ability to maintain the aroma and flavor of the coffee. On the other hand, freeze-drying involves freezing the liquid coffee extract and then removing the frozen water through sublimation, resulting in a soluble powder. Although more expensive, freeze-drying retains the coffee's natural characteristics better than spray-drying.</p></p>
