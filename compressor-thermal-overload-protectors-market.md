<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Compressor Thermal Overload Protectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Thermal Overload Protector</li><li>Built-in Thermal Overload Protector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Compressor Thermal Overload Protectors market includes two main types: External Thermal Overload Protectors and Built-in Thermal Overload Protectors. External Thermal Overload Protectors are devices installed outside the compressor, typically in a separate housing. They provide protection against overheating by monitoring the compressor's temperature and disconnecting it from the power source if it exceeds a predetermined limit. On the other hand, Built-in Thermal Overload Protectors are integrated within the compressor itself, constantly monitoring its temperature and automatically interrupting the power supply when necessary to prevent overheating and potential damage.</p></p>
