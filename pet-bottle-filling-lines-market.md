<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PET Bottle Filling Lines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Without Contact Valve</li><li>With Contact Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PET bottle filling lines can be categorized into two types: those without a contact valve and those with a contact valve. In lines without a contact valve, the bottles are filled using a non-contact filling method, such as gravity or pressure, where the liquid is directly filled into the bottles without any contact with a valve. On the other hand, lines with a contact valve involve the use of a valve mechanism that directly comes in contact with the bottles during the filling process. Both types have their own advantages and suitability based on specific needs and requirements.</p></p>
