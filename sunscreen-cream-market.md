<p><ul><li>Chemical Sunscreens</li><li>Physical Sunscreens</li></ul></p>

<p><p>The sunscreen cream market consists of two primary types: chemical sunscreens and physical sunscreens. Chemical sunscreens work by absorbing UV rays and converting them into heat, providing protection from the sun. They are typically lightweight, easily blendable, and can offer broad-spectrum protection. On the other hand, physical sunscreens create a physical barrier on the skin to reflect and scatter UV radiation. They are typically thicker and can leave a slight white cast, but are generally suitable for sensitive skin and offer immediate protection upon application.</p></p>
