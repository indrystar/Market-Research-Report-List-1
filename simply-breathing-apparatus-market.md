<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Simply Breathing Apparatus Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Circuit</li><li>Closed-Circuit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The breathing apparatus market consists of two main types: open-circuit and closed-circuit. In open-circuit breathing apparatus, the user breathes in air from the surrounding environment, and after exhaling, the air is released into the atmosphere. This type is commonly used in firefighting or industrial applications. In closed-circuit breathing apparatus, the exhaled air is filtered and recycled, which allows for longer periods of use. This type is often used in deep-sea diving or space exploration, where a continuous supply of breathable air is necessary.</p></p>
