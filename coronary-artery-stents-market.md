<p><h1>Coronary Artery Stents Market Research Report Reveals The Latest Trends And Opportunities of this Market for Period from 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Coronary Artery Stents Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Coronary artery stents are small, metallic mesh tubes that are used to treat blockages or narrowing of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscles. These stents are inserted into the affected arteries to help keep them open and improve blood flow, thereby reducing the risk of heart attacks and related heart diseases.</p><p>The global coronary artery stents market has been experiencing significant growth in recent years and is expected to continue growing at a CAGR of 14.3% during the forecast period. Several factors are driving this market growth, including the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, increasing cases of obesity and sedentary lifestyles, and technological advancements in stent design and materials.</p><p>One of the major trends in the coronary artery stents market is the shift towards drug-eluting stents (DES) from bare-metal stents (BMS). DES are stents coated with drugs that help prevent the re-narrowing of the arteries, known as restenosis. These stents have gained popularity due to their higher efficacy and reduced risk of complications compared to BMS. Moreover, advancements in drug delivery technologies and the development of bioabsorbable stents are further contributing to the growth of the DES segment.</p><p>Geographically, North America dominates the coronary artery stents market, primarily due to the high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, well-established healthcare infrastructure, and favorable reimbursement policies. However, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness the highest growth rate during the forecast period, attributed to the increasing geriatric population, changing dietary habits, and improving healthcare facilities in emerging economies.</p><p>Overall, the coronary artery stents market is poised for substantial growth in the coming years, driven by the growing burden of cardiovascular diseases and continuous technological advancements in stent design and drug delivery systems.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coronary Artery Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-metal Stent (BMS)</li><li>Drug-eluting Stent (DES)</li><li>Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The coronary artery stents market consists of three main types: Bare-metal Stents (BMS), Drug-eluting Stents (DES), and Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS). BMS are metallic stents used to treat blocked arteries by holding them open, but they do not release medication. DES, on the other hand, have a medication coating that helps prevent vessel re-narrowing. BVS are a newer type made of a material that eventually dissolves, allowing the vessel to return to its natural state. These different stents offer various options for treating coronary artery blockages.</p></p>
