<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Lubricant Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Under Load</li><li>Self-priming</li><li>Submersible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric lubricant pump market consists of three main types: under load, self-priming, and submersible pumps. Under load pumps are designed to operate while there is pressure on the pump, such as in heavy machinery or equipment. Self-priming pumps have the ability to draw in lubricant and create the necessary suction to start pumping without any external assistance. Submersible pumps are designed to be fully submerged in the lubricant and are commonly used in applications where the lubricant is located below ground level, such as in underground storage tanks.</p></p>
