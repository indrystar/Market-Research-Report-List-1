<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diesel Exhaust Scrubber Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Type</li><li>Closed Type</li><li>Hybrid Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Diesel Exhaust Scrubber Systems market consists of three types: Open Type, Closed Type, and Hybrid Type. Open Type systems eliminate pollutants from exhaust gases through a water-based solution, releasing the treated gases into the atmosphere. Closed Type systems, on the other hand, utilize a catalytic converter to remove pollutants and store them for later disposal. Hybrid Type systems combine the features of both Open and Closed Type systems, providing greater flexibility and efficiency in reducing emissions from diesel exhausts.</p></p>
