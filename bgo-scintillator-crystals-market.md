<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The BGO Scintillator Crystals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Czochralski Method</li><li>Bridgman Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>BGO scintillator crystals are commonly produced using two different methods - the Czochralski method and the Bridgman method. The Czochralski method involves slowly pulling a crystal from a molten solution, resulting in high-quality crystals suitable for use in medical imaging and security systems. On the other hand, the Bridgman method involves slowly solidifying a crystal from a molten solution, producing crystals with lower quality but at a lower cost, making them suitable for industrial applications.</p></p>
