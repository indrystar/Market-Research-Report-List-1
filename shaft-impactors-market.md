<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shaft Impactors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Shaft Impactors</li><li>Vertical Shaft Impactors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shaft impactors are machines used in the construction industry for crushing rocks, minerals, and other materials. There are two main types: horizontal shaft impactors (HSI) and vertical shaft impactors (VSI). HSI involves a horizontal shaft that rotates to crush material against anvils or curtains, resulting in smaller-sized particles. VSI, on the other hand, features a vertical shaft spinning at high speeds, which throws rocks against anvils, breaking them into smaller pieces. Both types offer efficient and versatile crushing solutions for various applications in the market.</p></p>
