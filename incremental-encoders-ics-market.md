<p><strong>The Incremental Encoders ICs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective Encoders</li><li>Transmissive Encoders</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Incremental Encoders ICs are electronic devices used to convert mechanical motion into electrical signals. Reflective Encoders utilize a light source, a code wheel, and detectors to determine the position of an object. They operate by reflecting light off the code wheel onto the detectors. Transmissive Encoders, on the other hand, employ a light source, a code wheel, and detectors to detect interrupted light. They function by transmitting light through the code wheel and detecting the interruptions created by the code pattern. Both types of encoders play a crucial role in position sensing applications.</p></p>
