<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Facade Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Ventilated Façade</li><li>Ventilated Façade</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Facade market types can be categorized into three main types: non-ventilated, ventilated, and others. Non-ventilated facades are characterized by a cladding system that does not allow air circulation between the facade and the building. These facades provide insulation and protection but may pose challenges related to heat accumulation. Ventilated facades, on the other hand, have a gap between the facade and the building, allowing air to circulate and dissipate heat, improving energy efficiency. The market for other facades includes solutions that do not fall into the aforementioned categories, such as double-skin or hybrid facades.</p></p>
