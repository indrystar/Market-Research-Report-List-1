<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soil Manifolds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pushfit Soil Manifolds</li><li>Welded Soil Manifolds</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Soil manifolds are used in plumbing systems to distribute wastewater from multiple outlets to a single main drain pipe. There are three main types of soil manifolds in the market: pushfit soil manifolds, welded soil manifolds, and others. Pushfit soil manifolds use a push-in fitting system, making them easy to install and remove. Welded soil manifolds are assembled by welding pipes together, providing a more secure and permanent connection. The "others" category refers to any other types of soil manifolds available in the market that do not fall under pushfit or welded categories.</p></p>
