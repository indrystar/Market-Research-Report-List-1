<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blood Glucose Test Strips Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glucose Oxidase</li><li>Glucose Dehydrogenase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Blood glucose test strips are widely used in the market for monitoring blood sugar levels in individuals with diabetes. There are two primary types of test strips: Glucose Oxidase and Glucose Dehydrogenase. Glucose Oxidase test strips use the enzyme glucose oxidase to convert glucose into gluconic acid, while Glucose Dehydrogenase test strips utilize the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase to convert glucose into gluconolactone. These reactions generate an electrical current that can be measured by a glucose meter, providing accurate blood glucose level readings. Both types of test strips serve the same purpose, but use different enzymes to achieve the desired outcome.</p></p>
