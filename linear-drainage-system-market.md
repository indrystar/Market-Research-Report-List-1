<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Drainage System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface</li><li>Underground</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The linear drainage system market consists of two main types: surface and underground. Surface drainage systems are installed above the ground to collect and divert water away from buildings, roads, and other structures. They typically include channels or grates that capture surface water and direct it towards a designated outlet. On the other hand, underground drainage systems are designed to collect and manage water below the ground surface. Pipes and underground chambers are used to collect and convey water to a suitable discharge point. Both types of systems play a crucial role in managing excess water and preventing flooding.</p></p>
