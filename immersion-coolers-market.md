<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Immersion Coolers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Cooling</li><li>Air Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The immersion coolers market is divided into two main types: liquid cooling and air cooling. Liquid cooling involves the use of a liquid, such as water or coolant, to transfer heat away from the device being cooled. This method is highly efficient and can cool devices more effectively than air cooling. On the other hand, air cooling uses air as a medium to dissipate heat and cool down devices. It is a simpler and more cost-effective solution but may not be as efficient as liquid cooling in some cases.</p></p>
